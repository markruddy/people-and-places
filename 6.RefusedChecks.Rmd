## Task

Check diary variables Cycleweek:MinsCar, Household:Car7min for data entered. Particularly coded as 'Refused to answer'.

```{r All relevant entries}

unite <- pp %>% 
  select(c(Cycleweek:MinsCar, Household:Car7min)) %>%
  gather(Variable, Entry)

dis <- unite %>%
  group_by(Variable) %>%
  distinct(Entry) %>%
  mutate(label = row_number(Variable))

wide <- spread(dis, Variable, Entry)

rm(unite, dis)

```

There are no 'refused to answer' coded values in any of these variables.


```{r Clean up}
rm(unite, dis, wide)
```
